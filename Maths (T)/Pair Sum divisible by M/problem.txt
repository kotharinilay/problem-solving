Problem Description:

Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the number of pairs in A whose sum is divisible by B.

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo (109 + 7).

Note: Ensure to handle integer overflow when performing the calculations.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length of the array <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1 <= B <= 10^6



Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 B = 2

Input 2:
 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 B = 28


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
 All pairs which are divisible by 2 are (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (3,5). 
 So total 4 pairs.

Explanation 2:
 There is only one pair which is divisible by 28 is (17, 11)


Solution Approach:
- Here problem statement suggests to fins number of pairs so that (arr[i] + arr[j]) % m = 0 because if sum of two 
number is divisible by any number m then modulo with that number will be zero
- So as per formula (arr[i] + arr[j]) % m = ((arr[i] % m) + (arr[j] % m)) % m = 0
- Now if we observe ((arr[i] % m) + (arr[j] % m)) % m = 0 then arr[i] % m and arr[j] % m will always between 0 to m-1.
Because if it become m then arr[j] % m will be 0.
- So, to find ((arr[i] % m) + (arr[j] % m)) % m = 0, (arr[i] % m) + (arr[j] % m) should always 0 or m. then only modulo 
with m will become 0.
- So first we will prepare frequency map of A[i]%B, keys of this frequency map will range from 0 to B-1.
- Now with two pointer left = 1 and right B-1, we need to get frequency of both numbers, and add multiplication of 
those two frequency to answer.
- Here we need to multiply frequency because that frequency denote numbers in array, so it's multiplication will denote 
number of pairs can be formed with those two numbers, which we will add to ans.
- 2 edge cases are there, for 0, number of  pairs will be n(n-1)/2, as it's same number and this is the formula to 
get number of pairs can be forms with n numbers.
- Also if B is even, there can be single digit (B/2), which can fulfill (arr[i] % m) + (arr[j] % m) = m, so for that 
number as well, we need to add n(n-1)/2 to answer.
