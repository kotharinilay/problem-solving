Problem Description:

You are given two positive numbers A and B . You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:
X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1


Problem Constraints:
1 <= A, B <= 10^9


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 30
 B = 12

Input 2:
 A = 5
 B = 10

Example Output
Output 1:
 5

Output 2:
 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
 All divisors of A are (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30). 
 The maximum value is 5 such that A%5 == 0 and gcd(5,12) = 1

Explanation 2:
 1 is the only value such that A%5 == 0 and gcd(1,10) = 1


Solution:
- Here we need A % X = 0, so that is clear that X is factor of A.
- So we first find factors of A.
- Now second condition is X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1
- So we can iterate over all factors of A and return if GCD of any factor with B is 1.
