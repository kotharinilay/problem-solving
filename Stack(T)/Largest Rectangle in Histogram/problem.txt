Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers A.
A represents a histogram i.e A[i] denotes the height of the ith histogram's bar. Width of each bar is 1.
Find the area of the largest rectangle formed by the histogram.

Problem Constraints:
1 <= |A| <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10000

Input Format:
The only argument given is the integer array A.

Output Format:
Return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example Input:
Input 1:
 A = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]

Input 2:
 A = [2]

Example Output:
Output 1:
 10

Output 2:
 2


Example Explanation:
Explanation 1:
The largest rectangle has area = 10 unit. Formed by A[3] to A[4].

Explanation 2:
Largest rectangle has area 2.


Solution:
- Here we need to check for each histogram: which is nearest smallest histogram available on left and right side.
- So maximum rectangle any histogram can form is: (height of current histogram) * (distance between nearest smallest histogram available on left and right side)
- So we need to prepare array of nearest smaller element on left and right side and maintain max rectangle histogram area based on above equation.
