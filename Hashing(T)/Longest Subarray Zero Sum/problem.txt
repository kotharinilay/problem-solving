Problem Description:
Given an array A of N integers.
Find the length of the longest subarray in the array which sums to zero.
If there is no subarray which sums to zero then return 0.


Problem Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [1, -2, 1, 2]

Input 2:
 A = [3, 2, -1]


Example Output
Output 1:
3

Output 2:
0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 [1, -2, 1] is the largest subarray which sums up to 0.

Explanation 2:
 No subarray sums up to 0.


Solution:
- Here we need to find subarray with sum 0, when we have problem with subarray sum we can think of prefix sum.
- at any index if we have same prefix sum element, means in between of those two indexes sum of all elements are 0.
- e.g. [5,1,-4,2,1,4] here for this prefix sum array will be [5,6,2,4,5,9] 0 and 4 index has value 5, means subarray (1,4) has sum 0
- Now we want longest subarray with sum 0, for that we will maintain hashmap, prefixsum element as key and its index as array as value
- When for any element value array has more than one element, we will calculate its length and maintain max length.
