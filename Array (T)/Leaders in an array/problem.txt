Problem Description:
Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if 
it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.


Problem Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^8


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]

Input 2:
 A = [5, 4]


Example Output
Output 1:
[17, 2, 5]

Output 2:
[5, 4]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.

Explanation 2:
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 4 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these two elements i.e [5, 4], we can also any other ordering.


Solution:
- Here we start iterating loop from last to first element
- As for last element it will leader as there is no elements to its right side
- we keep iterating left and maintain max number, and if current element is greater than max, then we can add it to ans array
- e.g. [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
    - 2 will be added to ans array and we keep 2 as max number till now, as its right most element, and we start iterating towards left
    - now 5 is next number, which is greater than 2, so ideally all elements to its right are smaller than it and we can add it
    to ans array and update max as 5.
    - similarly we can iterate till first element and keep maintaining max element and add ith element to ans if its max till then.
