Problem Description:
Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.

Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell the number 
of special integers less than or equal to A.


Problem Constraints:
1 <= A, B, C <= 10^9


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 12
 B = 3
 C = 2

Input 2:
 A = 6
 B = 1
 C = 4


Example Output
Output 1:
 2

Output 2:
 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.

Explanation 2:
 Only 4 is a positive integer less than equal to 6 which is divisible by 1 and 4.


 Solution:
 - Here we require divisors of B, C less than A, so we can find LCM of B and C, with which B and C both will be divisible.
 - Formula to find LCM of two numbers is: (A*B)/GCD(A,B)
 - Now we require all divisors below A, so we can iterate from LCM of B and C until it's less than A with multiple of LCM
