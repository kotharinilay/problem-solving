Problem Description:
Given an integer array A of size N. You have to delete one element such that the GCD(Greatest common divisor) of the 
remaining array is maximum.

Find the maximum value of GCD.


Problem Constraints:
2 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [12, 15, 18]

Input 2:
 A = [5, 15, 30]

Example Output
Output 1:
 6

Output 2:
 15

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 If you delete 12, gcd will be 3.
 If you delete 15, gcd will be 6.
 If you delete 18, gcd will 3.
 Maximum value of gcd is 6.

Explanation 2:
 If you delete 5, gcd will be 15.
 If you delete 15, gcd will be 5.
 If you delete 30, gcd will be 5.
 Maximum value of gcd is 15.


 Solution Approach:
 - Here GCD of remaining array elements after deleting any element will be GCD(GCD(left side elements), GCD(right side elements))
 - Now to avoid runtime calculation of GCD of left and right side sub arrays, we can prepare prefix and postfix GCD array
 - So when we delete any element, left side subarray's GCD will be preGCD[i-1] and eft side subarray's GCD will be postGCD[i+1]
 - and we can get GCD(preGCD[i-1], postGCD[i+1]), and manage max of them.
 - Here first and last elements will be edge case: for fist element we don't require left side's GCD, and similarly for 
 last element we don't require right side's GCD.
